## Research Interest

I am deeply fascinated by the study of squirrel hibernation, an interest driven by its implications for understanding mammalian hibernation and metabolic adaptations. My enthusiasm extends to examining the biological and environmental factors that influence hibernation cycles and survival strategies in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel. 

This research not only sheds light on the resilience and evolutionary adaptations of squirrels but also provides broader insights into ecological balance and potential applications in human medical science.
